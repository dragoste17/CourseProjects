Q.1) Input : array = [9,5,4,3,2,1,7,6]

     Run : python shell_sort.py

     Observations : i) By shell sort the given array was sorted in 8 steps, whereas it took 18 steps for
                       insertion sort to do the same.
                    ii) This method is much faster than the insertion sort





Q.2) Input : array = [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]

     Run : python compare_sort.py

     Observations : i) By using raw insertion sort we have 36 transactions required.
                    ii) By using two-check-alpha sort followed by insertion sort, and after using the value
                        of alpha as 15, the transactions required are 26, after checking for 50 repetitions.
                    iii) So using the second method is clearly better for sorting.

     Note: i) To get results of raw insertion sort only line 69 (twocheck(array))
              and line 73 (print k+alpha) are to be removed/commented.
           ii) Transactions invole only shifting and swapping tasks as reading is common in both.


Q.3) Run : python n_alpha.py
   
     Observations : The graph is observed and attached
